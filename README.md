Driver Fatigue Alert System
The Driver Fatigue Alert System is a software solution that uses machine learning and computer vision to detect driver fatigue and prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. This system is designed to work with a camera mounted inside the car, and it continuously monitors the driver's face and eyes for signs of fatigue.

When the system detects that the driver is becoming fatigued, it sounds an alarm or sends an alert to the driver, reminding them to take a break or stop driving altogether.

How to use the Driver Fatigue Alert System
Install the necessary dependencies, including OpenCV and TensorFlow.
Connect a camera to your computer and mount it inside your car, facing towards the driver's seat.
Run the Driver Fatigue Alert System software on your computer.
The system will automatically begin monitoring the driver's face and eyes for signs of fatigue.
If the system detects that the driver is becoming fatigued, it will sound an alarm or send an alert to the driver.
Technical details
The Driver Fatigue Alert System is built using Python and several machine learning and computer vision libraries, including OpenCV and TensorFlow. The system uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the driver's facial features and eye movements, looking for signs of fatigue, such as drooping eyelids or slow eye movements.

The CNN is trained using a dataset of images of drivers who are both alert and fatigued. During the training process, the CNN learns to differentiate between the two states and can accurately detect when a driver is becoming fatigued.

The system also includes a user interface that displays the camera feed and the current fatigue level of the driver in real-time. This allows the driver to monitor their own fatigue level and take proactive steps to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.

Future developments
In the future, we plan to improve the accuracy of the Driver Fatigue Alert System by incorporating additional sensors and data sources, such as heart rate monitors and GPS data. We also plan to make the system more user-friendly and accessible, with options for customization and integration with other devices and software solutions.
